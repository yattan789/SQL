Preparation Tips for Interviews
Understand Basic Concepts: Ensure you have a solid understanding of basic SQL operations, DDL, DML, and querying techniques.
Practice Query Writing: Regularly practice writing queries, including complex joins, subqueries, and aggregations.
Work on Performance Tuning: Learn how to read execution plans and optimize queries.
Study Real-world Scenarios: Understand how SQL is used in real-world applications, such as database design, transaction management, and security.
Review Theoretical Concepts: Make sure you understand key theoretical concepts, such as normalization and relational algebra.
Hands-On Practice: Use SQL on real datasets to get comfortable with different types of queries and database operations.
